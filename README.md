# Mapping Application

## Overview
This is a Spring Boot based application that demonstrates the use of MapStruct for object mapping in a Java environment. The application simplifies the process of mapping between different data models, enhancing maintainability and reducing boilerplate code.
The project demonstrates how a mapping problem could be solved in a Java Development Environment in the scope of a Student Assignment at the FHNW based on a real company case.
